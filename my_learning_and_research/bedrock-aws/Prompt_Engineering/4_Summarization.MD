In this lab, we will learn prompt engineering techniques for summarization. Summarization can be useful when users don't have time to read large documents, have too much content to consume, or want to better understand what's in a document before investing the time to read it.

Use cases include:

- Abbreviated content
- Quick descriptions of content
- Structured summaries
- Personalized summaries based on user interests
