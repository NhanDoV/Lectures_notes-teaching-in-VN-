## Practices
### Quiz 1: Metrics & Checks.
``` diff
@@ Question 1. It is possible to use metrics and checks on partitioned DSS objects.@@
```
- [x] **True, you can use metrics and checks on each partition of the partitioned object.**
- [ ] False, youâ€™ll have to unpartition the object in order to compute metrics and checks on it.

``` diff
@@ Question 2. Metrics can NOT be added to which of the following Flow items?@@
```
- [ ] Managed folders
- [x] **Recipes**
- [ ] Datasets
- [ ] Models

``` diff
@@ Question 3. In which of the following tabs of a dataset would a user be able to create a metric?@@
```
- [ ] Settings
- [ ] Statistics
- [ ] Explore
- [x] **Status**

### Quiz 2: Scenarios
``` diff
@@ Question 1. Which of the following are the two required components of a scenario? Select two.@@
```
- [ ] A reporter to send scenario information via several available channels
- [x] **A list of action(s) to run when a scenario launches**
- [ ] A code snippet to stop the scenario on certain conditions
- [x] **Trigger(s) that activate the scenario**

``` diff
@@ Question 2. Which of the following types of trigger would require custom code?@@
```
- [ ] Run when a dataset managed by Dataiku DSS changes.
- [ ] Run everyday at midnight.
- [ ] Run when another scenario finishes.
- [x] **None of these.**

``` diff
@@ Question 3. Which of the following is NOT a common use case of scenarios using the built-in options in Dataiku?@@
```
- [ ] Cleaning job logs weekly
- [ ] Running your flow daily when a change in a dataset is detected
- [x] **Automatically detecting the ML model features that need to be processed**
- [ ] Monitoring a ML model drift and retraining it

### Quiz 3: Custom Metrics, Checks & Scenarios.

### Final.
