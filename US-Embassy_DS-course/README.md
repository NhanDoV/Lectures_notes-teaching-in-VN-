# Overview.
This course included 3 classes with these following contents
- Introduce to Data Science. 
- Regression model
- Classification problem
- Natural Language Processing used Machine Learning algorithms and Deep Learning models
- EDA, ETL techniques
- etc

# Class 1. Introduce to Data Science. 
- In this first course, I want to briefly introduce Data Science, industries in the data field in general (DA, DE, DS, MLE, etc) and especially data scientists. In this course, we will learn together the basic concepts of regression models as well as object classification problems.

# Class 2. Classification problems
- After going through the first course together, in the next part we focus more deeply on the classification problem in case there are too many variables. Then we are forced to use a dimensionality reduction technique without losing too much meaning from the original data.

# Class 3. NLP project
- The last chapter is an application to the NLP problem, here is spam-detection. How will we apply the knowledge we have learned in previous courses to solve this problem?
- In the last chapter, I have put some light exercises here as a survey of the results that everyone has achieved together.
