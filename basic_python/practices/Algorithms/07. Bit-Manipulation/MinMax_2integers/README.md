# MaxMin_2num
## Overview
The `MaxMin_2num` class provides **four different approaches** to determine the **maximum and minimum** values of two **positive integers**.  
Each method demonstrates a unique way to solve the same problem — from direct comparisons to clever use of mathematical and bitwise operations.

### Contraints: Inputs num1 and num2 must be 32-bit signed integers

- Range: −2³¹ ≤ num ≤ 2³¹ − 1

- Both integers are assumed positive in this implementation (as noted in the class docstring).

- The implementation uses integer arithmetic only (no floating-point operations).

- No external libraries are required.

- Bitwise operations behave according to standard 32-bit integer rules in Python.
