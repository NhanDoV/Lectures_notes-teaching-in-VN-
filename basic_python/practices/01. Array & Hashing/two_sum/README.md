## Description
### Problem
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer target, return the indices `i` and `j` such that `nums[i] + nums[j] == target` and `i != j`.

You may assume that every input has exactly one pair of indices `i` and `j` that satisfy the condition.

Return the answer with the smaller index first.

### Examples
#### Example 1
```python
Input: 
nums = [3,4,5,6], target = 7

Output: [0,1]
```

#### Example 2
```python
Input: nums = [4,5,6], target = 10

Output: [0,2]
```

#### Example 3
```python
Input: nums = [5,5], target = 10

Output: [0,1]
```
