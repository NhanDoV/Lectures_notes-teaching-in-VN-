## Description
### Problem 

You are given an array of integers temperatures where temperatures[i] represents the daily temperatures on the ith day.

Return an array result where result[i] is the number of days after the ith day before a warmer temperature appears on a future day. If there is no day in the future where a warmer temperature will appear for the ith day, set result[i] to 0 instead.

### Examples

#### Example 1:
```shell
Input: temperatures = [30,38,30,36,35,40,28]

Output: [1,4,1,2,1,0,0]
