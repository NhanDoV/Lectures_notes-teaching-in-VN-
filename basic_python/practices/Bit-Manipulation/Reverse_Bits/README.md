Given a `32-bit unsigned integer n`, reverse the bits of the binary representation of n and return the result.

#### Example 1:

- Input: ``n = 00000000000000000000000000010101``

- Output:    `2818572288 (10101000000000000000000000000000)`

**Explanation**: Reversing `00000000000000000000000000010101`, which represents the unsigned integer 21, gives us `10101000000000000000000000000000` which represents the unsigned integer `2818572288`.
