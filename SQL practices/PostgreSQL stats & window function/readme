Have you ever wondered how data professionals use SQL to solve real-world business problems, like generating rankings, calculating moving averages 
and running totals, deduplicating data, or performing time intelligence? 
If you already know how to select, filter, order, join and group data with SQL, this course is your next step. 
By the end, you will be writing queries like a pro! You will learn how to create queries for analytics and data engineering with window functions, 
the SQL secret weapon! Using flights data, you will discover how simple it is to use window functions, and how flexible and efficient they are.

In this chapter, you'll learn three practical applications of window functions: fetching values from different parts of the table, ranking rows 
according to their values, and binning rows into different tables.

In this chapter, you'll learn how to use aggregate functions you're familiar with, like `AVG()` and `SUM()`, as window functions, as well as 
how to define frames to change a window function's output.
