### SQL Fundamental Track

### Overview  
This track equips you with fundamental skills to query and manipulate data using SQL, a powerful language widely adopted by data-driven organizations. Moving beyond Excel, you will learn to efficiently summarize data, join multiple tables, and utilize advanced SQL features such as window functions and PostgreSQL built-in functions to analyze complex data sets.

The curriculum is focused on hands-on exercises that prepare you for real-world data challenges.

### About the Track  
The courses in this track are designed based on DataCamp's top-rated SQL courses, from which I have earned certificates. You can verify the certificates here:
