So you've learned how to aggregate and join data from tables in your database—now what? 
How do you manipulate, transform, and make the most sense of your data? This intermediate-level course will teach you several key functions 
necessary to wrangle, filter, and categorize information in a relational database, expand your SQL toolkit, and answer complex questions. 
You will learn the robust use of CASE statements, subqueries, and window functions—all while discovering some interesting facts about soccer 
using the European Soccer Database.
