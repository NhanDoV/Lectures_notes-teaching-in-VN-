|     You’ve already used SQL to query data from databases. But did you know that there's a lot more you can do with databases?                 |
|     You can model different phenomena in your data, as well as the relationships between them. This gives your data structure and consistency,| 
| which results in better data quality. In this course, you'll experience this firsthand by working with a real-life dataset that was used to   |
| investigate questionable university affiliations. Column by column, table by table, you'll get to unlock and admire the full potential of     |
| databases.                                                                                                                                    |
|     You'll learn how to create tables and specify their relationships, as well as how to enforce data integrity.                              |
| You'll also discover other unique features of database systems, such as constraints.                                                          |

|                                                       CHAPTER 1.  YOUR FIRST DATABASE                                                         |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|      In this chapter, you'll create your very first database with a set of simple SQL commands.                                               |
|      Next, you'll migrate data from existing flat tables into that database.                                                                  |
|      You'll also learn how meta-information about a database can be queried.                                                                  |
|===============================================================================================================================================|
|                                   CHAPTER 2. ENFORCE DATA CONSISTENCY WITH ATTRIBUTE CONSTRAINTS                                              |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|      After building a simple database, it's now time to make use of the features. You'll specify data types in columns, enforce column        |
| uniqueness, and disallow NULL values in this chapter.                                                                                         |
|===============================================================================================================================================|
|                                     CHAPTER 3. UNIQUELY INDENTIFY RECORDS WITH KEY CONSTRAINTS                                                |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|      Now let’s get into the best practices of database engineering. It's time to add primary and foreign keys to the tables.                  |
|      These are two of the most important concepts in databases, and are the building blocks you’ll use to establish relationships between     |
| tables.                                                                                                                                       |
|===============================================================================================================================================|
|                                     CHAPTER 4. GLUE TOGETHER TABLES WITH FOREIGN KEYS                                                         |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|     In the final chapter, you'll leverage foreign keys to connect tables and establish relationships that will greatly benefit your data      |
| quality; and you'll run ad hoc analyses on your new database.                                                                                 |
