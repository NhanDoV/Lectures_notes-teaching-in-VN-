|    A good database design is crucial for a high-performance application. Just like you wouldn't start building a house without the benefit of |
| a blueprint, you need to think about how your data will be stored beforehand.                                                                 |
|    Taking the time to design a database saves time and frustration later on, and a well-designed database ensures ease of access and          |
| retrieval of information. While choosing a design, a lot of considerations have to be accounted for.                                          |
|    In this course, you'll learn how to process, store, and organize data in an efficient way.                                                 |
|    You'll see how to structure data through normalization and present your data with views.                                                   |
|    Finally, you'll learn how to manage your database and all of this will be done on a variety of datasets from book sales, car rentals,      |
| to music reviews.                                                                                                                             |

|                                            CHAPTER 1. Processing, Storing, and Organizing Data                                                |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   Start your journey into database design by learning about the two approaches to data processing, OLTP and OLAP.                             |
|   In this first chapter, you'll also get familiar with the different forms data can be stored in and learn the basics of data modeling.       |

|                                              CHAPTER 2. Database Schemas and Normalization                                                    |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   In this chapter, you will take your data modeling skills to the next level.                                                                 |
|   You'll learn to implement star and snowflake schemas, recognize the importance of normalization and see how to normalize databases to       |
| different extents.                                                                                                                            |

|                                                          CHAPTER 3. Database Views                                                            |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   Get ready to work with views! In this chapter, you will learn how to create and query views.                                                |  
|   On top of that, you'll master more advanced capabilities to manage them and end by identifying the difference between materialized and      |
| non-materialized views                                                                                                                        |

|                                                      CHAPTER 4. Database Management                                                           |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|    This final chapter ends with some database management-related topics.                                                                      |
|    You will learn how to grant database access based on user roles, how to partition tables into smaller pieces, what to keep in mind when    |
| integrating data, and which DBMS fits your business needs best.                                                                               |
