This course will provide you an understanding of how to use built-in PostgreSQL functions in your SQL queries to manipulate different types of 
data including strings, character, numeric and date/time. 
We'll travel back to a time where Blockbuster video stores were on every corner and if you wanted to watch a movie, you actually had to leave 
your house to rent a DVD! You'll also get an introduction into the robust full-text search capabilities which provides a powerful tool for 
indexing and matching keywords in a PostgreSQL document. And finally, you'll learn how to extend these features by using PostgreSQL extensions.
