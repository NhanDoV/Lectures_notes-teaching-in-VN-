# DESCRIPTION
## PART I.
> After all of the hard work of acquiring data and getting them into a form you can work with, you ultimately want to make clear, succinct conclusions from them. 
> This crucial last step of a data analysis pipeline hinges on the principles of statistical inference. 
> In this course, you will start building the foundation you need to think statistically, speak the language of your data, and understand what your data is telling you. 
> The foundations of statistical thinking took decades to build, but can be grasped much faster today with the help of computers. 
> With the power of Python-based tools, you will rapidly get up-to-speed and begin thinking statistically by the end of this course.
